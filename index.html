                    Most likely you are accessing this website because you had some issue with the traffic coming from this IP. This router is part of the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Anonymity Network</a>,     which is dedicated to providing people with anonymity who need it most: average computer users. This router IP should be generating no other traffic, unless it has been compromised.
                    While Tor is not designed for malicious computer users, it is inevitable that some may use the network for malicious ends. In the mind of this operator, the social need for easily accessible censorship-resistant anonymous communication trumps the risk.
                    Tor sees use by many important segments of the population, including whistle blowers, journalists, Chinese dissidents skirting the Great Firewall and oppressive censorship, abuse victims, stalker targets, the US military, and law enforcement, just
                    to name a few.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In terms of applicable law, the best way to understand Tor is to consider it a network of routers operating as common carriers, much like the Internet backbone. However, unlike the Internet backbone routers, Tor routers explicitly do not contain identifiable
                    routing information about the source of a packet.
                    As such, there is little the operator of this router can do to help you track the connection further. This router maintains no logs of any of the Tor traffic, so there is little that can be done to trace either legitimate or illegitimate traffic (or to
                    filter one from the other). Attempts to seize this router will accomplish nothing.

                    <i><b><u>plus</u></b></i> legal fees) in the event of a seizure executed without good faith or probable cause (it should be clear at this point that traffic originating here should not constitute probable cause to seize the machine). Similar considerations
                    exist for 1st amendment content on this machine.

                    That being said, if you still have a complaint about the router, you may send me an <a href="mailto:admin@selea.se?subject=Regarding%20your%20Tor%20Exit%20Node">email</a>. If complaints are related to a particular service that is being abused, I will consider
                    removing that service from my exit policy, which would prevent my router from allowing that traffic to exit through it. I can only do this on an IP+destination port basis, however. Common P2P ports are already blocked.
                </p>

                <p>
                You also have the option of blocking this IP address and others on the Tor network if you so desire. Dan Austin provides this <a href="https://www.dan.me.uk/torlist/?exit">list</a> over all Tor Exit Nodes in the network. Please be considerate when using these options. It would be unfortunate to deny all Tor
                    users access to your site indefinitely simply because of a few bad apples.
